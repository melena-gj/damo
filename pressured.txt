predecessor: pressured by people
message: Ahh that's a shame. It's quite common as well unfortunately :/
         Remember to ask people for help and advice whenever you need it btw.
         Who are you feeling pressured from?
next: family, friends, teachers, yourself


=======================================
> pressured:

predecessor: family
message: Ahhk, have you already discussed this with them?
next: Yes I have, No I haven't

predecessor: friends
message: Ah yep. TBH I think you should do what you think you should do, not what your friends do.
         You will stay good friends with your best friends regardless of where you go.
         And theres nothing better than making new friends who love what you love where you end up studying.
         I would have a chat with your family, a school career counsellor, and other people for their thoughts.
         Always remember you can switch programs/ defer if you change your mind in the future.

predecessor: teachers
message: Oh, interesting. They may have your interests at heart, but tell them your thoughts if you haven't yet.
         And theres nothing better than making new friends who love what you love where you end up studying.
         I would ask your family, a school career councillor, and ultimately yourself, what you want to do.

predecessor: yourself
message: Ahh yes, high standards are a double edged sword.
         It's good to push yourself to some degree, but at a point it starts doing more harm than good
         by stressing yourself out too much it starts to make it hard to study.
         Remember to take care of yourself, and please try not to be too self conscious and proud to ask your
         friends and family for help and advice, because they should often be pleased to give it.
         If the stress builds up, don't be afraid to ask for help. And give this a read if you want

> family:

predecessor: yes
message: Ahh, I understand that in some situations you can't simply go against the will of your parents.
         They will usually have your interests at heart, and they might even have a valid point... maybe you
         could give their degree a shot for a semester, but change program if you still think its not for you.
         If you were really set on following your own direction and not their desired one, remember that there
         are government services to help you in case this causes some serious rifts (for eg in http://www.lawstuff.org.au/sa_law/topics/when-can-I-leave-home)
next:

predecessor: no
message: I see. Communication is really important in life, and bring up uncomfortable issues is still less painful than putting them off. So I very much think you should tell them your thoughts.
         If you still disagree, then remember even if you go on to begin studying their prefered option, you're able to
         transfer and defer if it still doesn't gel for you.
