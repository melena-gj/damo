Careers and Uni:


predecessor: Yep!
message: Oh wow. You're beating me then :).
         Are you worried your not going to get in?
next: Yeah, Nah

predecessor: sort of...
message: Oh, are you having doubts about want you want? 
         Or did you want more info about your choice?
         Unless, you're worried you won't get the marks to get in? O.o
next: having doubts, want more info, worried you won't get the marks

predecessor: Not at all
message: Fair enough. It's pretty early in your life to have this figured out.
         Tbh, to get inspiration, a good start is to talk to people, whether its family,
         friends, or school counsellors.

         A good place to get started would be this career quiz :)

		 degrees 2 times mate, and plenty of my friends too :). Actually about 50% of students change their degree during their time at uni.

		  Did you want more info? Or help with anything else?
next: more info, MENU ITEMS(ALL but Career)

predecessor: want more info
message: I don't have a huge amount of expirience myself but have you thought about
